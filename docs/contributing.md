## Types of features not accepted

This project is sponsored by [EnvisionIt](https://envisionit.app/). 

It is provided in an _open core_ model - a mixture of open source and closed source software.

The open source part is the _configuration generator_ called Koncierge and is distributed with an Apache 2.0 license.

The closed source part is the _diagram generator_ and is provided as a service by EnvisionIt.

Because of this, we cannot allow this open source project to compete with EnvisionIt. 
Therefore, pull requests that add the following types of features will not be accepted:

- Generating diagrams to visualise the content. 
- Validating the Kubernetes configuration.
- High level dashboards. 
- Links to other websites or projects without prior approval.
